<h4>What is this website?</h4>
    <p>I'm building a friendly way to experience the Macintosh gaming experience of the 1990s and early 2000s "Classic" era. This site includes a collection of <b>{{ count }}</b> downloadable Macintosh game demos, <b>{{ infinitemac }}</b> of which can be played directly in a web browser courtesy of <a href="https://infinitemac.org/">Infinite Mac</a>.</p>
    <p>You'll also find <b>{{ sources }}</b> CD-ROM disc images, mostly coverdiscs from Macintosh magazines of the era. All the CDs can be explored in an <a href="https://infinitemac.org/">Infinite Mac</a> emulator. The CDs on this site are a combination of discs I've collected and <a href="https://archive.org/details/@jcgraybill">contributed to Internet Archive</a>, as well as disc images others have contributed to the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org">Macintosh Garden</a>, and <a href="https://macintoshrepository.org/">Macintosh Repository</a>.</p>
<h4>Why should I play a demo when I can just download the full game somewhere? 🏴‍☠️</h4>
    <p>Many of these games aren't abandonware! Remasters and modern adaptations are available for a lot of them, often offering significant quality-of-life improvements. Whenever possible, this site includes links to buy and play the full games, as well as to modern open-source builds from <a href="https://www.macsourceports.com/">Mac Source Ports</a>. Even the games that are now abandonware often used serial keys, copy protection, or DRM that's a nuisance to work around.  Demos were DRM-free - just click and play!</p>
<h4>How do I play one of these demos?</h4>
    <p>In most cases, just click "<span aria-hidden="true" class="fa-solid fa-play"></span> Play". If there's no play button for a game, it can be downloaded and played using a Classic-era Macintosh computer or an emulator. The guides at <a href="https://www.emaculation.com/">Emaculation.com</a> are an excellent way to get started with emulators. This site offers an <a href="http://www.classicmacdemos.com/">http-only version</a> accessible to vintage web browsers. Use <a href="https://stuffit.com/">Stuffit Expander</a> to decode and uncompress the downloads. Retro Mac OS X fans can enjoy many of these games in "Classic" mode on systems running Mac OS X versions up to and including Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.</p>
<h4>How do I get in touch with you?</h4>
